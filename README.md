# VTM NPC Progression Tool

A CLI and (eventually) TUI tool for creating and progressing Vampire: The Masquerade (V20) characters, specifically for creating NPCs.

This is a personal project for me to happily make character to use as a foundation or baseline for NPC characters. This is also an excuse to learn how to make TUIs with Python.


## Why?

How do I stat out a 500 year old Ministry character who just woke up? Standard character creation is designed for fledglings/neonates, not older and more experienced Kindred.

So this tool solves my problem by using age-based progression systems to generate a pool of freebie points that can be used to progress an existing starting character sheet to reflect the character's age, experience, and power. For me, I use it as a guide that gives me a mechanical basis for what an NPC can do. (You can break it if you want. You're the Storyteller)

> [!NOTE]
> This is specifically built for V20 because I make more V20 characters than V5. 😅

## Features (Planned)
- Character creation based on age and generation
- Generation limit enforcement (for max trait ratings above 5 dots)
- A fully interactive TUI built with Textual.
- (Future) Support for other custom progression systems.

## Getting Started
> Instructions for installation and usage will be provided here once the core CLI and TUI functionality is complete.

### Acknowledgements and System Credits

The core progression logic in this tool isn't mine! It's a direct implementation of the systems described in this great article: [Elder Creation System by Belladona on KismetRose.com](https://www.kismetrose.com/vtm/sc/character/Character03.html).

This tool is just a way to automate the math described in that article. Full credit for the design of the progression systems goes to the article's original author.
